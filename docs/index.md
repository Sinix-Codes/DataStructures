## **Data Structures** :computer:

Data structures are a way of organizing data in such a way that we can perform operations on these data in an effective way. Data structures are used to store collection of data, the relationship among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

## **Types of Data Structures** :information_source:

There are two types of data structures:

-   **Linear Data Structures**

-   **Non-Linear Data Structures**

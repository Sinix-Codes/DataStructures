## Introduction

A tree is a data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship. A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is made up of nodes where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, pointer to a parent node, and an array of children nodes. A tree data structure can represent information that naturally forms a hierarchy. For example, an organization chart is a tree structure.

## Terminology

-   **Root** - The top node in a tree.
-   **Child** - A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root.
-   **Parent** - The converse notion of a child.
-   **Siblings** - A group of nodes with the same parent.
-   **Leaf** - A node with no children.
-   **Edge** - The connection between one node and another.
-   **Path** - A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.
-   **Level** - Level of node is the number of edges on the path from the root node to the node.
-   **Height** - Height of node is the number of edges on the longest path from the node to a leaf + 1.
-   **Depth** - Depth of node is the number of edges from the node to the tree's root node.

## Types of Trees

-  **General Tree** - A tree data structure in which no node has a degree greater than two.
-  **Binary Tree** - A tree data structure in which each node has a degree of zero,one or max two.
-  **Binary Search Tree** - A binary tree in which the value of each node is greater than or equal to any value stored in the left sub-tree, and less than or equal to any value stored in the right sub-tree.
-  **Extended Binary Tree** - A binary tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.
-  **Complete Binary Tree** - A binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

## Binary Tree

A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child.

### Properties of Binary Tree

-  The maximum number of nodes at level ‚Äòl‚Äô of a binary tree is 2^l.
-  Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‚Äòh‚Äô is 2^(h) ‚Äì 1.
-  In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or minimum number of levels is  Log2(N+1)
-  A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least  Log2L + 1  levels

## Binary Search Tree

A binary search tree is a binary tree in which the value of each node is greater than or equal to any value stored in the left sub-tree, and less than or equal to any value stored in the right sub-tree.

### Properties of Binary Search Tree

-  The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node‚Äôs key.
-  The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node‚Äôs key.
-  The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree.
-  There must be no duplicate nodes.

## Complete Binary Tree

A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

Complete Binary tree looks like :

## Extended Binary Tree

An extended binary tree is a binary tree in which every node other than the leaves has two children.

General tree can be converted to extended binary tree by adding dummy nodes.

### Sequential Representation
.
    ![Sepqential](https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-8b624abadb47f61cee1cc99c6bdf3475)

#### Rules :

1. OneDirectional array called tree is used to store elements of tree.
2. The root of the tree will be at first index(instead of 0)
         i.e. tree[1] will store root node of tree

3. Children of node stored in location 2*k (left node) and
         2*k+1 (right node).........(k = parent node)

4. Maximum size of array "tree" is given as 2^h - 1

5.  An empty tree or subtree is specified by NULL
        i.e. tree[1]=NULL

## Traversing Binary Tree ü´±üèª‚Äçü´≤üèª

### Preorder Traversal

1. Visit the root.
2. Traverse the left subtree, i.e., call Preorder(left-subtree)
3. Traverse the right subtree, i.e., call Preorder(right-subtree)

### Inorder Traversal

1. Traverse the left subtree, i.e., call Inorder(left-subtree)
2. Visit the root.
3. Traverse the right subtree, i.e., call Inorder(right-subtree)

### Postorder Traversal

1. Traverse the left subtree, i.e., call Postorder(left-subtree)
2. Traverse the right subtree, i.e., call Postorder(right-subtree)
3. Visit the root.
